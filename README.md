# DragonBalSS
This repo provides the code for reproducing the experiments in [DragonBalls: self-supervised auto-balancing end-to-end  causal treatment effect estimation](). DragonBalSS is a multi-task deep neural network for causal treatment effect estimation able to achieve minimal dissimilarity in learning treated and untreated distributions, thanks to the adoption of a specific auto-balancing self-supervised objective.

# DragonBalSS
This repo provides the code for reproducing the experiments in [DragonBalls: self-supervised auto-balancing end-to-end  causal treatment effect estimation](). DragonBalSS is a multi-task deep neural network for causal treatment effect estimation able to achieve minimal dissimilarity in learning treated and untreated distributions, thanks to the adoption of a specific auto-balancing self-supervised objective. 

### Dependency

This implementation is based on Tensorflow and Keras. We recommend to create a proper enviroment with dependencies specified in ```env.yml``` (```env_gpu.yml``` for GPUs):

```
conda env create -f env.yml
```
